    <h2>About Us</h2>
        

    <p>We are a volunteer led organisation founded by a group of Russian Speaking mothers, who live in Southampton. Our aim is to create a Russian Speaking environment for children and adults, to provide opportunity to learn Russian Language, culture, traditions and to hold family and cultural events connected to the Russian culture</p>
        <p><b>Cultural events and family days</b> - we organise cultural events for the the families with competitions, games, art workshops and tasty snacks. Parents will have an opportunity to meet and communicate with each other over a cup of tea or coffee.</p>
        <p><b>Russian language school “Buratino”</b> - working along with Community Language Services, our purpose is to assist communities in preservation and cultivation of the Russian language.</p>

        <p>We have a very friendly and professional team of teachers and volunteer assistants, without whose selfless dedication this project would not have been possible. We managed to develop our own unique educational programs for children, taking into account their characteristics, interests, needs, as well as the objective comments of parents, whom we strive to involve in the educational process, since the family makes the main contribution to the development of the child's language personality. Therefore, we are always happy to conduct a dialogue with parents and provide any assistance in additional education for children.</p>
        <p>It is important for us that children, integrating into the local society, correctly assess themselves, understand their identity and carry the grain of Russian culture in themselves. The fundamentals of cultural studies and ethnography, folklore and traditions occupy a strong place in our educational program. We cheerfully celebrate holidays, birthdays, introduce children to folk games and amusements, hold open lessons at the end of the year, where we celebrate the successes of our students together with their parents.</p>
        <p>Of course, the school has its difficulties. So, at the moment, the issue of continuing the financing of the school in the next academic year is acute, since with the advent of the new government there is a massive budget cut. The refusal of financial assistance from the city administration may lead to a forced transition to self-financing, which means that the school will have to be reorganized and tuition fees increased. Unfortunately, this will mean that some students will no longer be able to visit us.</p>
        <p>We very much hope that this will not happen and we will be able to work as before, directing our forces to the implementation of new ideas and plans. I would like to pay more attention to the comprehensive development of the children, teaching them dancing, drawing, drama, cultural studies and etiquette. We have talented and enthusiastic educators who are willing to work to bring these ideas to life. We see the results of our work and believe that "Buratino" has a bright future!</p>
